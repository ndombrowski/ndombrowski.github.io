I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) in the Netherlands. 

Microbes are important for every aspect on the world. Despite that we know very little about some of them, since a large number of microbes can not be grown in the lab making it harder to study them. I am exactly interested in these little creatures using metagenomic and phylogenetic approaches.  Specifically, I am interested in understanding the lifestyle of ultra-small archaea (DPANN), a specific group of microbes that have such small genomes that don't allow them to live by themselves. Instead, they require a host to be able to grow and proliferate. 

I obtained my PhD studying microbial communities associated with plants and am now studying archaea in marine environments. To be able to do this work I developed a strong bioinformatic background and commonly work with BASH and R and recently added Python to my list of tools.

**As part of my research career I am developing tutorials for my students and you can also find some material on courses I taught [here](https://github.com/ndombrowski).**

### What I am currently working on:

- How are microbial communities structured + how strong affect environmental driving cues the assembly of microbial communities?
- How can we use OMICs to better understand the functional diversity encoded in microorganisms?
- How can we use phylogenetic approaches to uncover the evolutionary drivers that allow microbes to adapt to different environments?
- What is the genetic potential of microbes that take part in major nutrient cycles (i.e. fueling the carbon pump) and how is this potentially affected by environmental changes?

### Where I come from:

I did my PhD at the Max-Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne. I investigated the structure of rhizosphere and root-bacterial communities of *Arabis alpina* (using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) and investigated the effect of bacteria on plant-growth.

Specifically, I asked:

- How are bacterial communities affected by their surroundings/ what determines how bacterial communities assemble on plant roots (i.e. plant species, soil type, flowering timeâ€¦)?
- What is the effect of synthetic bacterial communities on plant growth?
