    "text": "I recently moved to Quarto to document my code and write reports and saw that it is also possible to create a website with Quarto, which turned out to be surprisingly easy.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nClick me to go to the Quarto documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quarto webpage comes with an excellent documentation, which I recommend you have a look at first. After doing so myself, I started with setting up a template for a blog by typing this into my terminal:\n\nquarto create-project myblog --type website:blog\n\nThis creates a folder with the name myblog (so change the name in the command above if you want to have a more creative name) that includes all the required templates to immediately build a test website.\nI changed some things to make these templates fir my personal needs. For example, I added more categories, such as a Projects and Publications, into the navbar and moved my personal information to starting page instead of having the blog appear there. Everything I did is documented on my GitHub page (more on that below), so if you want to have some inspiration feel free to have a look here.\nTo see if what I did worked, I just needed one command to check the state of my website:\n\nquarto preview\n\nOnce I was happy, I rendered the website with:\n\nquarto render\n\nNext, the big question was where to publish my website and luckily quarto works well with different publishing services, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify and it even comes with its own publishing service, Quarto pub. I tried out all three and decided to stick with GitHub Pages since I anyhow use GitHub to back up my code.\nFirst I created an empty github repository in order to setup a GitHub Pages site. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this you can find a step-by-step guide here.\nNext, the only thing I had to do was:\n\nSet the source branch of the GitHub pages to the gh-pages branch and set the repository to root\nIgnore some of the files in my folder by adding some lines in the .gitignore:\n\n/.Quarto/\n/_site/\n\n\nOnce that was set the only thing I had to do was publish the site with\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nAnd voila, here we are!"

    "text": "I am interested in gaining insights into the biology and evolution of archaea belonging to the DPANN superphylum, a group of archaea recently discovered using metagenomic approaches. Specifically, I am interested in:\n\nUnderstanding how diverse DPANN archaea are in marine environments\nTrying to identify the interaction partners of DPANN archaea using metagenomic approaches?\nFinding the position of DPANN in the archaeal tree of life and addressing the question, whether symbiosis evolved early in the archaeal domain?\n\n\n\n\nFind out more:\nGenomic diversity, lifestyles and evolutionary origins of DPANN archaea\nTalking about a novel phylum in the DPANN archaea\n\n\n\nThe Black Sea is a stratified, anaerobic marine environment and as such provides extremely stable conditions. Using metagenomic approaches we want to compare microbial communities at different depths and untangle the nutrient interdependencies of microbes in the water column and the sediment. Our preliminary data suggests that DPANN archaea are extremely diverse and abundant in the Black Sea making it an idealy environment to study them in more detail."

    "text": "My general research focus is on the role of microbes in different environments, ranging from the soil, hydrothermal vents and the open ocean. In all environments on earth microbes play a key role in breaking down organic matter or driving different nutrient cycles, such as the carbon cycle. Despite their importance, many microbes can not be grown (and thus tested for their relevance) in the lab. I am specifically interested in such (so far) unculturable microbes and use computational approaches, such as metagenomics or phylogenomics, as techniques to characterize their genomes.\nCurrently, I am studying a group of symbionts belonging to the DPANN archaea. DPANN archaea have very small genomes, most might rely on a host to be able to grow and very few of them can be grown together with their hosts in a laboratory setting. Therefore, little is known about their role in microbial food webs.\nI obtained my PhD studying microbial communities associated with plants and looked at what kind of microbes can be found on the roots of different plant species and tested some of these microbes for plant-growth promoting activities.\nMost of this work is done using bioinformatic approaches (and I am rarely seen in the lab these days). As part of my research career I am developing tutorials for my students and you can also find some material from courses I taught here."
