## Teaching

Here are some general programming tutorials I have created that you might find useful:

- [A tutorial on using UNIX and an HPC](https://ndombrowski.github.io/cli_workshop/)
- [Getting started with the command line](https://ndombrowski.github.io/Unix_tutorial/#sed-manipulating-files) including [example files](https://github.com/ndombrowski/Unix_tutorial)
- [An introduction to AWK](https://ndombrowski.github.io/AWK_tutorial/) with [example files](https://github.com/ndombrowski/AWK_tutorial)
- [An R cookbook](https://ndombrowski.github.io/R_cookbook) with [example files](https://github.com/ndombrowski/R_cookbook)
- [Data manipulation with dplyr](https://ndombrowski.github.io/Tidyverse_tutorial/)
- [Data visualization with ggplot2](https://github.com/ndombrowski/Ggplot_tutorial)

For biologists, I also have tutorials on:

- [Assembling a metagenome](https://ndombrowski.github.io/Assembly_tutorial/)
- [Genomic binning](https://ndombrowski.github.io/Binning_tutorial//index.html)
- [Annotating microbial genomes](https://github.com/ndombrowski/Annotation_workflow)
- [How to do phylogenetic analyses](https://ndombrowski.github.io/Phylogeny_tutorial/) with [example files](https://github.com/ndombrowski/Phylogeny_tutorial)
