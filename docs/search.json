    "text": "I am interested in gaining insights into the biology and evolution of archaea belonging to the DPANN superphylum, a group of archaea recently discovered using metagenomic approaches. Specifically, I am interested in:\n\n\nUnderstanding how diverse DPANN archaea are in marine environments\nTrying to identify the interaction partners of DPANN archaea using metagenomic approaches?\nFinding the position of DPANN in the archaeal tree of life and addressing the question, whether symbiosis evolved early in the archaeal domain?\n\n\n\n\n\nI am also investigating the microbial diversity and nutrient dependencies of microbes in the Black Sea.\n\n\nThe Black Sea is a stratified, anaerobic marine environment and as such provides extremely stable conditions. Using metagenomic approaches we want to compare microbial communities at different depths and\nUntangle the nutrient interdependencies of microbes in the water column and the sediment.\nPreliminary data suggests that DPANN archaea are extremely diverse and abundant in the Black Sea. Therefore, we will also use this as a study site to address some of the questions asked above."

    "text": "Microbes are important for every aspect on the world. Despite that we know very little about some of them, since a large number of microbes can not be grown in the lab making it harder to study them. I am exactly interested in these little creatures using metagenomic and phylogenetic approaches. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the lifestyle of ultra-small archaea (DPANN), a specific group of microbes that have such small genomes that don’t allow them to live by themselves. Instead, they require a host to be able to grow and proliferate.\nI obtained my PhD studying microbial communities associated with plants and am now studying archaea in marine environments. To be able to do this work I developed a strong bioinformatic background and commonly work with BASH and R and recently added Python to my list of tools.\nAs part of my research career I am developing tutorials for my students and you can also find some material on courses I taught here."
