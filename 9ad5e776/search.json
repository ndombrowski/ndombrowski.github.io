I am using computational approaches to understand the role of micro- (and soon macro-) organisms in various environments such as the soil, hydrothermal vents and the open ocean.\nMicrobes play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and driving nutrient cycles, such as the carbon cycle, in all environments on earth. However, many microbes cannot currently not be grown in the lab leading to many open question about their metabolism and their role in a given environment. During my work I use computational methods, such as metagenomics or phylogenomics, to characterize these organism based on their DNA alone.\nIn addition to supporting scientists, I also develop tutorials for my students.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Getting started\nI recently decided that it is time to update my personal website and realized that the system I used did not fit my needs anymore. So …. what to do?\nI recently moved to Quarto to document my code and write reports and saw that it is also possible to create websites as well, which turned out to be surprisingly easy. To make this work, you should have Quarto installed and have a basic understanding of the markup language Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nClick me to go to the Quarto documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quarto webpage comes with an excellent documentation, which I recommend you have a look at first. After doing so myself, I started setting up a template for a blog by typing this into my terminal:\nquarto create-project template --type website:blog\nThis creates a folder with the name template (so change the name in the command above if you want to have a more creative name) that includes all the required templates to immediately build a test website.\nYou can have a look at how this website would look like. Do do this, go into the newly created template folder and type:\nquarto preview\nThis should give you a first impression and if you use the preview option your page should update as you work on it. Initially, the page should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonalizing our website\nIn order to have a website more suited to reflect my academic work, I wanted to add more categories into the navigation bar to, for example, describe what I currently work on (my Projects) and list my publications on another site. To do this, I added new quarto files for each category, such as projects.qmd, publications.qmd, into my website folder, changed the titles and filled each document with content.\nI also didn’t want my starting page to be the blog page but I want viewers to first get some basic information about me. To do this I changed the file names like this:\nmv index.qmd blog.qmd\nmv about.qmd index.qmd\nAll of these changes have to be reflected in the configuration file (the file that controls how the different parts of a website are organized), which for us is called _quarto.yml. To add the new pages and organize them to the left and right in the navigation bar I changed the YAML file to contain the following:\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"\"\n  navbar:\n    title: false\n    left:\n      - text: \"Nina Dombrowski\"\n        file: index.qmd\n    right:\n      - blog.qmd\n      - projects.qmd\n      - cv.qmd\n      - publications.qmd\n      - icon: github\n        href: github.com/\n      - icon: twitter\n        href: https://twitter.com/\n\nIf we have look how our website looks now, then we should see something like this:\n\n\n\nMuch better! Now, I just proceeded and filled the different pages with more personal information.\n\n\nChanging the theme\nIf you look more closely into the configuration file, you can see that we use a custom theme, cosmo. There are other schemes you can choose from and these already look very nice.\nHowever, I wanted to learn how to have more control over my website and for this we can use CSS. First, we have to generate a new file, theme.scss and then tell our _quarto.yml configuration file that we want to use this custom scss theme:\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: theme.scss\nWithout going into too much detail, the theme.scss allows us to control every aspect of our webpage. For example, I wanted to change the color of the navbar, change the color of my text, justify the text and make center my figure legends (as I for my projects page). To do so, I changed some settings in the theme.scss:\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n// Navbar colors\n$primary: #1A5276  !default;\n\n// Links\n$link-color: #0E86D4 !default;\n\n// Fonts\n$font-family-base: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Noto Sans\", \"Liberation Sans\", Arial, sans-serif !default;\n$headings-font-family: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Noto Sans\", \"Liberation Sans\", Arial, sans-serif !default;\n$body-color: $gray-900 !default;\n$body-text-align: justify !default;\n\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\n\n//Figure settings\nfigcaption.center {\n    text-align: center;\n    color: $gray-800;\n    font-size: 12px;\n    font-style: italic;\n}\nOnce, I was happy with my website, I rendered it with:\nquarto render\nI am still working on the details, especially the CSS part, but in case you want some inspiration, all code can be found here.\n\n\nPublishing our website\nNext, the big question was where to publish my website and luckily quarto works well with different publishing services, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify and it even comes with its own publishing service, Quarto pub. Quarto pub and Netlify are very easy to setup: you create an account, be sure to be logged into the account and publish the webpage with:\nquarto publish\nI tried out all three and decided to work with GitHub Pages since I anyhow use GitHub for my code.\nGitHub Pages take a bit more to get started. First I created an empty github repository in order to setup a GitHub Pages site. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this you can find a step-by-step guide here.\nNext, the only thing I had to do was:\n\nSet the source branch of the GitHub pages to the gh-pages branch and set the repository to root\nIgnore some of the files in my folder by adding some lines in the .gitignore:\n\n/.Quarto/\n/_site/\n\n\nOnce that was set the only thing I had to do was publish the site with\nquarto publish gh-pages\nAnd voilà, here we are!"

    "text": "Postdoc at the NIOZ (Netherlands)\n Exploring the hidden world of DPANN archaea using metagenomic approaches \nAs a Postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) in the Netherlands, I was working in the lab of Dr. Anja Spang.\nMy research focused on using metagenomic approaches to investigate archaea, one of the main divisions of life alongside Bacteria and Eukaryotes. Archaea live in a variety of habitats on Earth, including soils, sediments, marine and freshwater environments, and even the human gut.\nThrough metagenomics, we can sequence DNA directly from environmental samples and reconstruct genomes from uncultivated organisms. This technique has revealed the diversity of microbial life and the roles of these organisms in their habitats. In particular, the DPANN archaeal superphylum contains a large diversity of putative symbiotic organisms, many of which have small genomes and limited metabolic capabilities, suggesting that they rely on other microbes for growth and survival. The few DPANN archaea that have been cultivated are likely obligate symbionts or parasites.\n\n\n\nGoing from DNA to reads to contigs to genomes\n\n\nMy research focused on gaining insights into the biology and evolution of DPANN archaea. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the diversity of DPANN archaea in marine environments, developing approaches to identify the interaction partners of DPANN archaea, and finding the position of DPANN in the archaeal tree of life. This will help to address the question of whether symbiosis evolved early in the archaeal domain.\n\n\n\nRight: Placing the Undinarchaeota, , members of the DPANN archaea, into the archaeal tree.  Left: Potential dependencies of Undinarchaeota with a host as inferred from metagenomics.\n\n\nFind out more:\n\nGenomic diversity, lifestyles and evolutionary origins of DPANN archaea\nTalking about a novel phylum in the DPANN archaea\n\n\n Investigating Microbial Diversity and Nutrient Dependencies in the Black Sea \nAs a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), I also investigated microbial communities in the Black Sea using metagenomic approaches. This stratified and anaerobic marine environment provides stable conditions that make it an ideal study site.\nThrough this research line, we aim to compare microbial communities at different depths and untangle the nutrient interdependencies of microbes in both the water column and sediment. Our preliminary data has revealed that DPANN archaea are extremely diverse and abundant in the Black Sea. As such, we are working to build methods to predict the host of these DPANN archaea based on sequencing data.\nBy understanding the microbial diversity and nutrient dependencies in the Black Sea, we hope to gain a better understanding of how these microorganisms interact with their environment and contribute to global biogeochemical cycles.\n\n\n\nCollecting water samples from the Black Sea"
